# JS Advanced Concepts Study

This file documents my notes covering a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj9uZuEI0pcyIL6CXw4qoYsGhyBZkhKlv) over the topics below.  It includes key concepts, questions, and other ponderings.

## Design Patterns

At their core, design patterns are problem-solving patterns, best practice solutions for common problems.  As a bonus, they help keep code clean and less buggy.

### Builder Pattern

The builder pattern is used as an alternative to complex constructors or cases where you aren't passing in a value for every parameter in a constructor.  Instead of passing `undefined`, the builder pattern allows you to chain methods that add specific property values to the object.

As an alternative for simple objects, it is also possible to pass in optional parameters as a JSON object.  You can even set a default value for a property with `=`.

### Facade Pattern

## Spread Operator

## Memoization

## Callbacks
